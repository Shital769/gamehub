Today, I tried to learn TypeScript and a few latest technologies used in industries. I havenâ€™t done a big project here, but a simple  mini project using React, TypeScript, React Hook Form and Zod just to learn new ideas and to share them with you all at the same time. 

In this project, I have learned about React Hook Form, Ref Hook, Schema-based validation library Zod and many other features in TypeScript. 

> To handle form submissions, we set the onSubmit attribute of the form element. 

> We can use the ref hook to access elements in the DOM. 

> React Hook Form is a popular library that helps us build forms quickly with less code. With React Hook Form, we no longer have to worry about using the ref or state hooks to manage the form state. 

> We can validate our forms using schema-based validation libraries such as joi, yup, Zod, etc. With these libraries, we can define all our validation rules in a single place called a schema.
